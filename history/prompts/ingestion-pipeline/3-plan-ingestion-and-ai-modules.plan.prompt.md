# Plan ingestion and ai modules

## Command
```
@.claude/agents/rag-engineer.md Plan the `services/ingestion.py` and `services/ai.py` modules.
```

## Response
Completed implementation planning for the ingestion pipeline feature. Created comprehensive plan including technical context, constitution compliance check, project structure, research findings, data models, quickstart guide, and API contracts. The plan covers both the ingestion service for handling file uploads and processing, and the AI service for classification and embedding generation. All artifacts created in the 002-ingestion-pipeline feature directory.
