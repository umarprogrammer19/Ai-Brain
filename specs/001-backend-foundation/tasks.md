# Tasks: Backend Foundation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-backend-foundation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend project**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/` at repository root
- Paths adjusted based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create backend project structure per implementation plan
- [X] T002 Initialize Python project with FastAPI, SQLModel, asyncpg, pgvector dependencies using uv
- [X] T003 [P] Create requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt files
- [X] T004 [P] Configure pyproject.toml for project settings
- [X] T005 [P] Setup Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization
- [X] T006 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (black, flake8, mypy)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T007 Setup database connection framework in backend/src/config/database.py
- [X] T008 [P] Configure environment configuration management in backend/src/config/settings.py
- [X] T009 [P] Setup base SQLModel class in backend/src/models/base.py

- [X] T012 Configure logging infrastructure in backend/src/utils/security.py
- [X] T013 Setup dependency injection utilities in backend/src/api/deps.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - System Foundation (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Establish backend foundation with FastAPI, database connection to Neon, and basic CRUD operations for core entities

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on models from US1
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on models from US1, may integrate with US2
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on models from US1, may integrate with other stories
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with other services

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 2 together:
Task: "Implement KnowledgeDoc service in backend/src/services/knowledge_service.py"
Task: "Create KnowledgeDoc API endpoints in backend/src/api/v1/knowledge_docs.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 4
   - Developer E: User Story 5
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
